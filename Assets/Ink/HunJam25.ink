ENGI: That's me! The engineer.

ENGI: Another day and I am ready for another...

CHEF: Another what?

ENGI: ...concoction of course! Have to keep those wheels turning.

ENGI: And how are your wheels?

CHEF: My wheels..?

ENGI: Oh! I mean your... spoons?

ENGI: Sorry I get sucked into the all-nighters and tinkering sometimes.

CHEF: I can see that. Do you take breaks at least?

ENGI: The spaceship needs attention at all times!

ENGI: But I like working with you guys so far.

ENGI: For the better - or maybe worse - goals.

ENGI: So I guess these will be my breaks.

CHEF: I'm glad. Maybe try to limit your caffeine intake though.

CHEF: Haven't seen you without a coffee so far.

ENGI: You wound me, that's what fuels me. 

ENGI: I wonder how many days I could go without food, hmm...

CHEF: Maybe don't try that.

CHEF: ...I'm not sure if that's relieving. How are you allowed to smoke in here?

NAVI: Heehee... //:)

NAVI: Let's call it Navigator's Privilege.

CHEF: Anyway. How's the journey?
